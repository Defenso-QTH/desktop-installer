timecounter issue with VirtualBox guest
    kern.timecounter.hardware=i8254

No more ntpdate?  Slows boot where network not immediately available.

No PolicyKit.conf changes for gnome?  KDE?

Make sure that the freetype module is loaded.  If it is not, add the following
line to the "Modules" section of your X Windows configuration file:

	Load "freetype"

Add the following line to the "Files" section of X Windows configuration file:

	FontPath "/usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/dejavu/"

Note: your X Windows configuration file is typically /etc/X11/XF86Config
if you are using XFree86, and /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you are using X.Org.


======================================================================

This OpenJDK implementation requires fdescfs(5) mounted on /dev/fd.

If you have not done it yet, please do the following:

	mount -t fdescfs fdesc /dev/fd

To make it permanent, you need the following line in /etc/fstab:

	fdesc   /dev/fd         fdescfs         rw      0       0
