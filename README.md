desktop-installer
=================

Desktop-installer is a post-install script for configuring a desktop
environment on a stock FreeBSD system.

FreeBSD has all the features needed to make a great desktop system for most
users, but fully configuring it by hand would be a laborious process.

Desktop-installer automates the process for most common desktop environments.
