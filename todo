Works for some iMacs:

    hint.hdaa.0.config="ovref"
    hint.hdaa.0.gpio_config="0=set"

Maybe enable speakers and headphone auto-switch?

    dev.hdaa.0.gpio_config="0=set 1=set"
    hw.snd.default_unit=1
    hint.hdaa.0.nid20.config="as=4 seq=15"

Make sure /etc/hosts has a fqdn matching the hostname

    127.0.0.1 localhost.localhost.domain hostname.domain hostname
    same for ::1

Install anacron?
    one suggestion from vans9@yandex.ru
    I've meant those peoriodic tasks that are already in /etc/crontab - daily, weekly, monthly. They seem to run almost never at desktops, that work on daily basis and are switched off at evening. But. the other side of enabling the the periodic through anacron is that roots mail will be spammed with the periodic reports. To avoid this, there shoud be line in periodic.conf making periodic to write it's repots to file, and syslod-ng rotating this files and maybe other things should be done..... So it's an overtask for the desktop-installer possibly.

Separate code for general setup and desktop installation? (vans)
